## Project Overview

PDF to Podcast Generator is a microservices-based application that converts PDF documents into natural podcast-style audio conversations. The system extracts text from PDFs, generates engaging dialogue using Large Language Models, and synthesizes high-quality audio using Text-to-Speech technology.

---

## Features

- Digital PDF text extraction with support for text-based PDFs up to 10 MB
- AI-powered script generation with natural host and guest conversation format
- Enterprise inference endpoints for LLM-based script generation
- High-quality audio generation using OpenAI TTS with 6 different voice options
- Modern React web interface with real-time progress tracking
- Integrated audio player with waveform visualization
- Project management and organization with download functionality
- RESTful API for integration with JSON-based communication

---

## Architecture

This application uses a microservices architecture where each service handles a specific part of the podcast generation process. The React frontend communicates with a backend gateway that orchestrates requests across three specialized services: PDF processing, script generation, and audio synthesis. The LLM service uses enterprise inference endpoints with token-based authentication for script generation, while the TTS service uses OpenAI TTS API for audio generation. This separation allows for flexible deployment options and easy scaling of individual components.

This application is built using FastAPI microservices architecture with Docker containerization.

**Service Components:**

1. **React Web UI (Port 3000)** - Handles file uploads, displays generation progress, and provides audio playback interface

2. **Backend Gateway (Port 8000)** - Routes requests to microservices and manages job lifecycle and state

3. **PDF Service (Port 8001)** - Extracts text from PDF files using PyPDF2 and pdfplumber libraries (no external API dependencies)

4. **LLM Service (Port 8002)** - Generates podcast dialogue scripts using enterprise inference endpoints with token-based authentication

5. **TTS Service (Port 8003)** - Synthesizes audio using OpenAI TTS API with multiple voice support and audio mixing

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker and Docker Compose**
- **Enterprise inference endpoint access** (token-based authentication)

### Verify Docker Installation

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Docker Compose version
docker compose version

# Verify Docker is running
docker ps
```

### Required API Keys

**For LLM Service (Script Generation):**

This application supports multiple inference deployment patterns:

**GenAI Gateway**: Provide your GenAI Gateway URL and API key
  - URL format: https://api.example.com
  - To generate the GenAI Gateway API key, use the [generate-vault-secrets.sh](https://github.com/opea-project/Enterprise-Inference/blob/main/core/scripts/generate-vault-secrets.sh) script
  - The API key is the litellm_master_key value from the generated vault.yml file

**APISIX Gateway**: Provide your APISIX Gateway URL and authentication token
  - URL format: https://api.example.com/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
  - Note: APISIX requires the model name in the URL path
  - To generate the APISIX authentication token, use the [generate-token.sh](https://github.com/opea-project/Enterprise-Inference/blob/main/core/scripts/generate-token.sh) script
  - The token is generated using Keycloak client credentials

Configuration requirements:
- INFERENCE_API_ENDPOINT: URL to your inference service (example: https://api.example.com)
- INFERENCE_API_TOKEN: Authentication token/API key for your chosen service
- INFERENCE_MODEL_NAME: Model name (default: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B)

**For TTS Service (Audio Generation):**

OpenAI API Key for text-to-speech:
- Sign up at https://platform.openai.com/
- Create API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Key format starts with `sk-proj-`
- Requires access to TTS APIs (tts-1-hd model)

### Local Development Configuration

**For Local Testing Only**

If you're testing with a local inference endpoint using a custom domain (e.g., `api.example.com` mapped to localhost in your hosts file):

1. Edit `api/llm-service/.env` and set:
   ```bash
   LOCAL_URL_ENDPOINT=inference.example.com
   ```
   (Use the domain name from your INFERENCE_API_ENDPOINT without `https://`)

2. This allows Docker containers to resolve your local domain correctly.

**Note:** For public domains or cloud-hosted endpoints, leave the default value `not-needed`.

---

## Quick Start Deployment

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/Enterprise-Inference.git
cd Enterprise-Inference/sample_solutions/PDFToPodcast
```

### Set up the Environment

Each service needs its own `.env` file. Copy the example files and edit with your credentials.

**1. PDF Service Configuration:**

```bash
cp api/pdf-service/.env.example api/pdf-service/.env
```

No changes needed. Uses default values.

**2. TTS Service Configuration:**

```bash
cp api/tts-service/.env.example api/tts-service/.env
```

Open `api/tts-service/.env` and replace `your-openai-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

Available TTS voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer. Default voices are alloy (host) and nova (guest).

**3. LLM Service Configuration:**

```bash
cp api/llm-service/.env.example api/llm-service/.env
```

Open `api/llm-service/.env` and configure your inference endpoint with the values from the "Required API Keys" section above.

**Note:** If using a local domain (e.g., `api.example.com` mapped to localhost), also edit `LOCAL_URL_ENDPOINT` and replace `not-needed` with your domain name (without `https://`).

**4. Backend Service Configuration:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Note:** If using a local domain (e.g., `api.example.com` mapped to localhost), edit `.env` and replace `not-needed` with your domain name (without `https://`).

### Running the Application

Start both API and UI services together with Docker Compose:

```bash
# From the PDFToPodcast directory
docker compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode (background)
docker compose up -d --build
```
The Backend will be available at: http://localhost:8000

The UI will be available at: http://localhost:3000

The LLM-service will be available at: http://localhost:8002

The PDF-service will be available at: http://localhost:8001

The TTS-service will be available at: http://localhost:8003

**View logs**:

```bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Backend only
docker compose logs -f backend

# Frontend only
docker compose logs -f frontend

# Specific service (pdf-service, llm-service, tts-service)
docker compose logs -f pdf-service
docker compose logs -f llm-service
docker compose logs -f tts-service
```

**Check container status**:

```bash
# Check status of all containers
docker compose ps

# Check detailed status with resource usage
docker stats

# Check if all containers are running and healthy
docker ps --filter "name=pdf-podcast"
```

**Verify the services are running**:

```bash
# Check API health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8002/health

# Check individual service health
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # PDF Service
