## 1. Overview

This guide outlines the procedure for deploying and managing models on an existing Enterprise Inference cluster

The Enterprise Inference cluster must already be provisioned and operational before proceeding with model deployment. If the cluster is not yet deployed, [follow the deployment guide](README.md#3post-os-enterprise-inference-deployment)

**This document covers:**

Deploying models from the Enterprise Inference catalog

Deploying custom models directly from Hugging Face

Undeploying models safely
---

## 2. Environment Prerequisites

- **Host System:** Control plane or master node with access to the inference stack
- **Cluster Access:** Existing or newly provisioned Kubernetes cluster
- **Certificates:** Valid cluster certificate (`cert.pem`) and private key (`key.pem`)
- **Hugging Face Token:** Required for downloading models from Hugging Face
- **Script Path:** `~/Enterprise-Inference/core/inference-stack-deploy.sh`

---

## 3. Model Deployment Workflow

1. Deploy from pre-integrated Enterprise Inference model catalog
2. Deploy directly from Hugging Face

Both use the same interactive script and menu flow.

### 3.1 Deploy Models from Enterprise Inference Catalog

This method deploys pre-integrated and validated models optimized for Enterprise Inference.

**Step 1: Run the Deployment Script**

```bash
sudo ./deploy-enterprise-inference.sh -u <username> -p <password> -t <hf-token> -g gaudi3 -a <cluster-url>
                              or
bash ~/Enterprise-Inference/core/inference-stack-deploy.sh
```

**Step 2: Navigate Through the Menus**

Choose the following options from the menu:

**3** – Update Deployed Inference Cluster

**2** – Manage LLM Models

**1** – Deploy Model

**Step 3: Select Model to Deploy**

The script displays a list of available models and their corresponding numeric IDs based on the selected deployment type (CPU or Gaudi).

When prompted to `Enter numbers of models to deploy/remove (comma-separated)`, enter the model ID you want to deploy (example: `1`).

**Step 4: Confirm Deployment**

When prompted to `Do you wish to continue? (y/n)`, type **y** to proceed.

**Once confirmed:**
- The model is deployed automatically to the inference cluster.
- All required Kubernetes Pods, Services, and Endpoints are created.

**Test:**

Run the following command to verify that the model pod is in the `Running` state.
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Test the model inference.

if EI is deployed with apisix, follow [Testing EI model with apisix](../EI/single-node/user-guide-apisix.md#5-test-the-inference) for generating token and testing the inference

if EI is deployed with genai, follow [Testing EI model with genai](../EI/single-node/user-guide-genai.md#5-test-the-inference) for generating api-key and testing the inference

---

### 3.2 Deploy Models Directly from Hugging Face

This option allows deploying any Hugging Face model, including models not pre-validated by Enterprise Inference.

**Step 1: To deploy**
```bash
sudo ./deploy-enterprise-inference.sh -u <username> -p <password> -t <hf-token> -g gaudi3 -a <cluster-url>
                              or
bash ~/Enterprise-Inference/core/inference-stack-deploy.sh
```
**Step 2: Navigate Through the Menus**

Choose the following options from the menu:

**3** – Update Deployed Inference Cluster

**2** – Manage LLM Models

**4** – Deploy Model from Hugging Face

**Step 3: Provide Hugging Face Model Details**

When prompted to `Enter the Hugging Face Model ID`, enter the desired Hugging Face model ID (example: `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3`).

> Note: The model(mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3) above is only an example. You can enter any compatible Hugging Face model (CPU or Gaudi), depending on your deployment type.

**Step 4: Provide Deployment name for the model**

When prompted to `Enter the Hugging Face Model ID`, enter the desired Hugging Face model ID (example: `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3`).

> **Naming rules:**
> - Lowercase letters only
> - Numbers and hyphens allowed
> - No spaces or special characters
> - Must follow Kubernetes naming conventions

**Step 5: Provide Tensor Parallel Size (Gaudi Only)**

Set the tensor parallel size based on available Gaudi cards.

> Note: > **Note:** This option deploys a model that has not been pre-validated. Ensure the tensor parallel size is configured correctly. An incorrect value may cause the model to remain in a "Not Ready" state.

**Step 6: Confirm Deployment**

When prompted to `Do you wish to continue? (y/n)`, type **y** to proceed.

**Test**

Run the following command to verify that the model pod is in the `Running` state:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Test the model inference.

if EI is deployed with apisix, follow [Testing EI model with apisix](../EI/single-node/user-guide-apisix.md#5-test-the-inference) for generating token and testing the inference

if EI is deployed with genai, follow [Testing EI model with genai](../EI/single-node/user-guide-genai.md#5-test-the-inference) for generating api-key and testing the inference

## 4. Undeploy Models

Enterprise Inference allows you to safely undeploy models that were deployed either from:
- The Enterprise Inference model catalog
- Directly from Hugging Face

### 4.1 Undeploy Models from Enterprise Inference Catalog

This method is used for models deployed through pre-integrated and validated models for Enterprise Inference.

**Step 1: Run the Deployment Script**
```bash
sudo ./deploy-enterprise-inference.sh -u <username> -p <password> -t <hf-token> -g gaudi3 -a <cluster-url>
                              or
bash ~/Enterprise-Inference/core/inference-stack-deploy.sh
```
**Step 2: Navigate Through the Menus**

Choose the following options from the menu:

**3** – Update Deployed Inference Cluster

**2** – Manage LLM Models

**2** – Undeploy Model

**Step 3: Select Model to Remove**

The script displays a list of available models with their model IDs based on the deployment type (CPU or Gaudi).

When Prompted to `Enter numbers of models to deploy/remove (comma-separated)` - Enter the model ID you want to remove(Example: 1)

**Step 4: Confirm Model Removal**

When prompted to `Do you wish to continue? (y/n)`, type **y** to proceed.
> CAUTION: Removing the Inference LLM Model will also remove its associated services and resources, which may cause service downtime and potential data loss.

**Once confirmed:**
 - The model deployment is deleted
 - All associated Kubernetes resources are removed

**Test**

Run below command to confirm, if the model pod is deleted.
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
---

### 4.2 Undeploy Models Deployed from Hugging Face

To remove Models deployed via Deploy Model from Hugging Face

**Step 1: Run the Script**
```bash
sudo ./deploy-enterprise-inference.sh -u <username> -p <password> -t <hf-token> -g gaudi3 -a <cluster-url>
                              or
bash ~/Enterprise-Inference/core/inference-stack-deploy.sh
```
**Step 2: Navigate Through the Menus**

Choose the following options from the menu:

**3** – Update Deployed Inference Cluster

**2** – Manage LLM Models

**5** – Remove Model using deployment name

**Step 3: Provide Deployment Name**

When prompted to `Enter Deployment Name for the Model`, provide a deployment name (example: `mistral-7b-v0-3`).

> The deployment name must exactly match the name used during model deployment.

**Step 4: Confirm Removal**

When prompted to `Do you wish to continue? (y/n)`, type **y** to proceed.
> CAUTION: Removing the Inference LLM Model will also remove its associated services and resources, which may cause service downtime and potential data loss.

**Once confirmed:**
 - The model deployment is deleted
 - All associated Kubernetes resources are removed

**Test**

Run below command to confirm, if the model pod is deleted.
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
